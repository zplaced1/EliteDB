# EliteDB
Parses Elite Dangerous databae files from edsm
As of now, it has an overkill rust + duckdb implementation for the 500gb+ data dumps from edsm/spansh and a smaller typescript parser for the smaller 7day/1month files.

Use the official rust/cargo installer for the duckdb implementation or bunjs for the smaller ts implementation
